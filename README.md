# CREDIT CARD APPROVAL PREDICTION
### Capstone Project
## INTRODUCTION:
The "Credit Card Approval Prediction" project aims to optimize the credit card application approval process for a forward-thinking bank's credit card department. In an era where data science plays a crucial role in financial institutions, the primary focus is to acquire new credit card customers while minimizing risks. The bank employs a data-driven credit assessment system known as Credit Scoring, which includes an application scorecard model. This scorecard assists in determining credit card approval by estimating the applicant's risk level based on strategic priorities. To make informed decisions, the bank leverages applicant data and external data sources.
